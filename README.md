This Datapack aims to make potions in Minecraft more useful, as they don't clutter your inventory anymore.

Usage:

Load potion into wand: hold Potion in you offhand while holding the Wand in your Mainhand. Then jump or sneak.
Switch between potions: transfer wand into your offhand (eg. by using F).
Use potions: rightclick Wand. Throwable potions will be thrown, otherwise you will drink them and get your bottle back.
