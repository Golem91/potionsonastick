# PotionsOnAStick

This Datapack aims to make potions in Minecraft more useful, as they don't clutter your inventory anymore.

For this Pack to work properly, you need to download and install the [ResourcePack](https://github.com/Golem91/PotionOnAStickResources/releases/download/V1.1/potionsonastickresources.zip).

# Usage:

Hold potion in your offhand while holding the Wand in your mainhand. Then jump or sneak to add it to the sticks "inventory"

Transfer wand into your offhand (eg. by pressing F) to cycle between stored potions.

Rightclick Wand to use a potion. Throwable potions will be thrown, otherwise you will drink them and get your bottle back.

# Crafting:
As of v1.0 you can craft the Wand using 2 Sticks, 2 Amethyst Shards and 1 Blaze Rod:

Alternatively it gets droped when you kill a Witch.

# Display:

![image of the displaying of the potions](https://github.com/Golem91/potionsonastick/blob/main/display.png?raw=true)

The Name of the currently selected potion as well as the count of the potions of that very type is displayed right next to the name.

Below are shown up to 12 additional potions with their count in front of them.
They are displayed in the order they will be loaded when switching to the next one.

After 12 Potions it will show the number of additional potions also loaded into the Wand.

You can load up to 100 potions in total into one Wand. You can also have multiple Wands if you wish to.

# Credits
Everything of the Code has been done by me (DerGolem91).

The ResourcePack has also been done by me, however the actual sprite of the Wand has been made by Chara.

Releases and Publishing are done by me.
