# PotionsOnAStick

This Datapack aims to make potions in Minecraft more useful, as they don't clutter your inventory anymore.

For this pack to work properly, you need to download and install the [ResourcePack](https://github.com/Golem91/PotionOnAStickResources/releases/latest).

This pack can be used with all Minecraft versions beginning with Snapshot 24w06a.

# Usage:

Hold potion in your offhand while holding the wand in your mainhand. Then jump or sneak to add it to the wand's "inventory".

Transfer wand into your offhand (eg. by pressing F) to cycle between stored potions.

Right click wand to use a potion. Throwable potions will be thrown, otherwise you will drink them and get your bottle back.

# Crafting:
As of v1.0 you can craft the wand using 2 Sticks, 2 Amethyst Shards and 1 Blaze Rod:

Alternatively it gets droped when you kill a witch.

# Display:

The name of the currently selected potion as well as the count of the potions of that very type is displayed right next to the name.

Below are shown up to 12 additional potions with their count in front of them.
They are displayed in the order they will be loaded when switching to the next one.

After 12 Potions it will show the number of additional potions also loaded into the wand.

You can load up to 100 potions in total into one wand. You can also have multiple Wands if you wish to.

You can also see the type of potion currently loaded on the side of the wand.
